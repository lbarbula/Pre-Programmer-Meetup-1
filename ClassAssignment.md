#Class Assignment 4/2

##Spec:

For this assignment please answer the following questions in a [Public GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Make sure to save the Gist with the '.md' extension so your Markdown formats properly:

1. In a PARAGRAPH: What are you most interested in learning? Why? What ideas do you want to bring to life or what projects do you want to build?
2. In an ORDERED LIST: What languages are you most interested in learning? Next to each one, write a sentence about why?
3. In an UNORDERED LIST, provide LINKS to websites or web apps that inspire you. Next to each one, explain what you like about them.

####The documentation for the Markdown markup language is [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

####The page you are reading is written in Markdown. So is [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/mrjaimisra/76ef9ddceb6a540a100c90c411904aa8) I posted in the meetup group as a response to Daniel Dwyer's question.

####Please add your Gist links here in the following format:
